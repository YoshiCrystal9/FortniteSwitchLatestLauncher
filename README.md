# Nintendo Switch Fortnite Latest Launcher

Made by AntogamerYT to make Epic Games Auth easier
This is useless if you aren't banned by Nintendo.

This fork doesn't have a proper update checker yet.

## Building

Make sure you have DevKitPro/MSYS2 installed 

- Clone the repo
- Install switch-curl in your environment
- Run `make`

This should produce an nro in the root folder of the project, transfer it on your switch and enjoy
